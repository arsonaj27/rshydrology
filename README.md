# Surface Water Area Estimation and Trend Analysis Using Remote Sensing Data

This repository offers a straightforward time series analysis of surface water mapping for the Kulekhani Reservoir.

The Surface Water Monthly script is a Google Earth Engine (GEE) script that facilitates downloading and managing surface water animations on a monthly basis. Monthly maps can be generated using the surfacewatermappingmonthly script, which is designed specifically for creating surface water maps on a monthly scale.

To extract surface water areas from the JRC dataset on a monthly basis, you can run the Yearly Plots.py file, which generates time series data based on the JRC dataset. Similarly, the Monthly Plots Yearwise file provides access to monthly datasets and enables year-wise visualization of surface water data.
